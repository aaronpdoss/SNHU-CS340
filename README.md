# SNHU-CS340
In order to create software that can be easily maintaided I focused on ensureing it could be easily transferred and modular. An example of this can be seen with how I took code from previous assignments and directly used it within the final project. The primary tool I use when approaching problems is critical thinking. Taking a look at a problem broadly then breaking it down into its individual parts ensures that I am able to appropriately address each part of the project without leaving any details out. I would say that for future databases, I would like to do mmore testing throughout the development process versus doing a majority of my testing and debugging towards the end. This will help ensure that the testing load is not too much to deal with.
